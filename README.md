# benchmark

"Benchmark for Minions" is a simple benchmark for your CPU and HDD. 

The CPU benchmark tests your CPU at real time values so the result 
depends heavily on whether if you have a lot of running processes 
and on your power plan settings, that is why the results might 
be different from what you already know or might know about 
your processor.

The HDD benchmark computes your HDD writing and reading speeds.
The benchmark is written by three students of Politehnica University 
Timisoara:  Ioan Georgevici, Bogdan Iancic, Mara Ianculescu.
To keep the trend with big companies, we are collecting anonymous 
data from your benchmark, so that we can improve it. By running
the benchmark you agree to help us improve it.
